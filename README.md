# Purpose
This program is designed to help in the analysis of abalone data, giving tools to calculate and examine different attributes and groupings. It has an interactive structure that guides users through a series of options to derive meaningful conclusions from the data

# Processing Data
The program prompts the user to type the name of the csv file containing abalone data. In this case, there's two options as examples.

The variable abalone_data stores the data after reading it, where each row in the file corresponds to a list and each element represents a specific attribute of the abalone.

The program calculates each abalone's economic value based on certain conditions and adds two more attributues: a category and the calulcated economic value.

# User Interaction
The program presents the user with a menu to choose from several actions, such as: finding average, maximum, minimum, standard deviation, and searching for a specific abalone

# Must install Numpy
pip install numpy
